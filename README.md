Summary
=====
Sample of .NET reference applicationThis helps to understand what are those basic concept in Domain Driven Design better and this is also kind of common architecture which help to solve those common problems which we will meet when we start a project. 



Getting Started
-------
First of all, you should have basic concept about what is Domain Driven Design and what's benifit we can get from this, I will recommend the book from Eric Evans' <Domain-Driven Design –Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software> which will get you through what could a DDD be.

Secondly, this is for those architects who want to built common architecture.

Notes
---
This is based on .net framework 4.6.2, not the .net core. Be aware of this is not a CQRS architecture, but it will coming soon later.

Architecture overview
-------
This architecture base on the DDD recommended classic layer.
